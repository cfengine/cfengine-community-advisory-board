# Potential Topics

## CFEngine Champion Selection
Nick: I think it would be nice if the community were more involved in Champion
Selection, even taking over the responsibility.

## Content Sharing
Nick: As a community we have had limited success in sharing policy within the community. The mailing list is a resource, but not a good one for referencing current policy that is actively being developed. We have some great frameworks, but they are entire frameworks, not select policy that is easily shared. Is there something we can do about this?

I have started creating a repository for each individual service that I write
policy for. I have been linking to them from here
https://github.com/cfengine-content/registry

## 3.8 Planning
Nick: 3.7 is probably to close to make many changes to. What things do you
think are important for 3.8? What can the community start working on? What do
you need help from CFEngine with in order to enable you?
