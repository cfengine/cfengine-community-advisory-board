## CFEngine Champion Selection
Nick:

  I think it would be nice if the community were more involved in Champion
  Selection, even taking over the responsibility.

## Content Sharing
Nick:

  As a community we have had limited success in sharing policy within the
  community. The mailing list is a resource, but not a good one for referencing
  current policy that is actively being developed. We have some great frameworks,
  but they are entire frameworks, not select policy that is easily shared. Is
  there something we can do about this?

  I have started creating a repository for each individual service that I write
  policy for. I have been linking to them from here
