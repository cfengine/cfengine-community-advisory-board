*** Discussion
**** Branding
  - CFEngine carries much history with it, some
    of that history like kicking off the whole configuration
    management concept, knowledge management, promise theory, it's
    lean footprint, and cross platform capabilities is good. However
    CFEngine 2 while successful in its own right, has cast a shadow on
    CFEngine 3. Google searches can turn up very old information and
    people have memory of some of the difficulties in using
    CFEngine 2. This can lead to the belief that CFEngine is old
    technology. On the contrary CFEngine has continued to evolve and a
    branding change may be beneficial in communicating that.
    - Several think re-branding should come with a redesign of code or
      some new behavior like promise and function plugins.
    - Re-branding should come with new getting started
      documentation
    - It is generally supported by the board members in attendance and
      most think the community would not care
    - Probably no need to make changes to libraries or binaries

*** Feedback on 3.6.6
 - Neil not using, moving to 3.7 instead
 - Mike on 3.6.2, testing 3.7 now, will probably roll 3.7.2
   - 3.6.2 has been rock solid, one of the best releases yet
 - Ted said good safe release, no behavior changes observed (other than
   new functionality)
 - Mike, and Jonathan say they are really appreciative of
   stabalisation of code in 3.6, its paid off
 - Rudder is still on 3.6.5 have not looked at 3.6.6

*** Feedback on 3.7.0
 - outside of new features ted thinks it works just like 3.6
 - Neil said the new logging output is good and much easier to read
 - Ted noted that the timing output is very nice and that we could
   easily build a profiler to replace cfe-profiler
   - This could play into the theme for 3.8
 - Ted and Neil think the def.json facility needs to be moved to C at some
   level. Many beginners stupmped with evaluation order.

*** Feedback on 3.8
 - Performance
  - Everyone thought the focus on performance is good and Neil noted
    that it would be nice to have a profiler come with it.
  - Jonathan said that copying lots of small files is really slow and
    is interested in performance with regard to policy distribution

 - Phased roll out
  - Mike excited about phased roll out
    - Everyone hacks their own, would be nice to have this in the core product.
  - Jonathan concerned about phased roll out. He wants to see useful
    generic abstract functions that don't require using a bunch of
    specific policy from masterfiles or somewhere else.
    - Ted agrees at least some of it should be moved to c and
      functions
  - Neil would like to see bootstrap option for the path to the policy
    - cf-agent --bootstrap HUB --masterfiles /var/cfengine/prod-masterfiles
  - Mike has automatic roll out implemented
    - push to master and an automated process merges from master to
      branch a to b to c etc .. the auto-merger does a merge once
      every 15 minutes

*** CFEngine Champion Selection
    - The board members agreed to do the champion selection.
    - The community members know the most about other community
      members

*** Content Sharing
 - We do not have a good way to distribute and consume policy
 - We have EFL and NCF which are good alternative frameworks, but not
   designed for people to pick and choose the policy they want.
 - We will all continue to think about this and elicit feedback from
   other users
 - Suggested to ship more examples with the package

*** Off Topic Chatter
  - Mike says it would be nice if there were something like a daily
    splayclass, instead of beicoming active once a day, become active
    and stay active.
