    Neil had asked what the community advisory board has accomplished.

    The primary accomplishment of the board has been sustained open
    communication between the community leaders and the company. Some
    specific areas where this can be seen:
    - 3.8 development priorities shared in advance
    - Releases happen in public channels
    - Specifications being done in the open
      - [[https://dev.cfengine.com/issues/7416][Alternative file/data transfer protocol]]
      - [[https://dev.cfengine.com/issues/7132][Policy digest map]] (Result of board meeting)
      - [[https://dev.cfengine.com/issues/7469][Phased Roll Out]]
      - [[https://dev.cfengine.com/issues/6404][Renewed package promise implementation]]
      - [[https://dev.cfengine.com/issues/7615][def.json/augments file from C]] (discussed at length during this
        board meeting)

     Familiarity with proposal:
     - Mike somewhat unfamiliar.
     - Bas, and Neil, Nick, and of course Ted think its a good approach

     Discussion:
     - Ted
       - Allows external services to configure cfenigne without
         editing cfengine files
     - Eystein has concerns
       - Thinks we need a more generic solution
       - Issues with variales/classes not parsed early enough has been
         a cluser of problems in the past, for inventory, design
         center now this.
       - common for people to read stuff from an external file and use
         that in policy
         - definition of role (db, web, etc ... ), firewall rules, etc
         - This is essential the same problem
         - This extra parsing for solving one very specific bug yeilds
           extra complexity to an already complex parsing process
       - Offered Alternative approach
         - Rely on modules to parse early data
         - instead of having ad-hoc way to parse def.json and perhaps
           others, rely on the module protocol that way it can easily
           be extended to anything
         - drawback is executables would be running as part of parsing
         - Ted
           - Executables add uncertainty and fragility to the startup
             behavior
           - This is the facter/ohai route, which seems to work well
             for puppet and chef
           - Neil: We should draw on what works with other
             products. Sometimes feel we are stuck in a bubble.
           - We could have def.json key modules, that lists the
             modules that should be run
             - Neil: Good idea
             - Eystein: Circular dependancy
               - How is it circular? def.json lists moduels, which get run
               - Eystein: parse def.json to read modules, and if module reads def.json it seems circular
             - Then we don't have the problem with evaluation
         - Bas
           - Dependant on the language its written in, how are modules
             being called, must ewe edit the config files to activate
             them?
           - Eystein
             - For def.json module it could be made very portable,
               perhaps a c program built like the cf-agent
             - Additional modules are up to the user
     - Additional alternatives and hybrid approaches
       - Def.json from C with modules key to configure the modules (as
         described by eystein) that should run very early
       - def_json module that reads def.json and then kicks off other
         modules as needed

     The summary of the options has been updated in the
     ticket. See [[https://dev.cfengine.com/issues/7615][Redmine #7615]] for more details.

*** Meeting should move to video conference or phone call
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       21845641-35a7-4f79-adfd-defd2301be7a
:END:
    Mike suggested that the meeting may go faster if moved to
    video/phone. Widely agreed upon. Specifics to be worked out later.

    Downsides:
    - No text conversation to review when making these meeting
      minutes.
    - Technology and video issues are common, IRC is lowest common
      denominator.

*** Policy Testing
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6ead120c-a18a-492c-ad0f-490f7d9abc2b
:END:
    Raised by Neil.

    Would like to promote ways to test cfengine policy and ways to
    prove your policy works.

    - Ted
      - Writes tests using the core test framework
      - Uses a [[https://github.com/bahamat/docker-cfengine-policy-hub][docker hub]] and leverages filesystem diff reports from
        docker tools
    - Nick
      - Writes tests using core test framework
      - Uses [[https://docs.cfengine.com/latest/guide-installation-and-configuration-general-installation-installation-enterprise-vagrant.html][CFEngine Enterprise Vagrant Environment]]
    - Neil
      - Interested in marriage between [[http://serverspec.org/][serverspec]] and [[https://testanything.org/][TAP]]
    - Mike
      - A testing promise type might be interesting
        - Ted
          - Could be done with promise plugins

    While its an important topic, no actions were identified except to
    continue to try and raise awareness by promoting various peoples

*** Goals that can be accomplished without CFEngine the company
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5eced97a-a39f-4210-ab1d-48bf627f58db
:END:
    Raised by Neil.  The board should focus on goals that can be
    achieved without having to rely on the company as goals and
    priorities frequently differ.

    Neil would like for the board to take on projects that can be
    accomplished. The only current project Identified is selecting the
    next batch of CFEngine Community Champions.

*** Champion Selection
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e9e58c25-2d81-4739-b6ad-c02c2a4f47ab
:END:
    - One candidate identified by board
    - Pool of candidates identified by board
    - Nick to send out community form for wider input

    Should champions be for life, or yearly? Up till now it has been
    for life. No large motivation to change from that. The Champions
    tend to remain active community members.

    - Current champion page lists past champions, suggested to change to single page
      - Nick to do the work

*** Networking Industry moving towards full blown linux distros for switching and routing
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3dadbfd8-0721-498f-9484-3c3a2ac49867
:END:
    Raised by Mike

    - Lack of packages for switching and routing platforms hampers
      adoption of CFEngine in this space.
    - Lack of real revenue opportunities limit CFEngine the company
      from investing heavily.
      - CFEngine has previously done work with Arista and Cumulus
        Networks
    - Chicken and egg problem
    - IPV6 is important
