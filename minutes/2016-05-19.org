** Discussion

Currently proposed topics:

- [X] Multiple Augments pre-parsing
- [X] Explicit iteration proposal
- Looking at other community initiatives
- Closures and functions to revamp map functions
- Back-porting macros for 3.6.x
- Policy Testing
- CFEngine and Network Devices
- Policy hash map
- Documentation reviews

The meeting ended somewhat early as we had low turn out.

***  [[jira:CFE-2084]] Multiple Augments

- Bas
  - Fine with it if he can specify the order of the augments files and that the
    last one should win.
  - Will review further and comment on ticket.

*** [[jira:CFE-2378]] Explicit iteration

The proposal is to add an attribute that allows you to specify the variable that
is used for iteration. Any =$(this)= in the promise gets iterated. Perhaps
=$(this.k)= and =$(this.v)= to support arrays.

The main benefits of this proposal are:
- Avoids necessity of creating intermediate variables
  - This can make policy harder to read as the intermediate variables can
    obfuscate the intention.
  - This can help with avoiding the duplication of data un-necessarily.
  - Classic arrays are more expensive internally than data containers since each
    key value pair is its own variable.
    - Perhaps use of this pattern will result in more efficient agent runs.
    - This needs to be better clarified by a developer in the ticket.
