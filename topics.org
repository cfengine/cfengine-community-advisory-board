Typically you'd deal with this with a closure, e.g. map(canonify(key()), mylist)
where `key()` gives you the key of the current iteration without a variable
interpolation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[10:22] < basv> I have proposal every configmannagement tool has some standard, like recipies, you name it. With the aid of shortcut in
                cf-serverd we could standarize data, templates, json, etc and writte bundles that use this shortcuts. So we setup some
                kind of repository. Just a wild idea
