2) Advertise for nominations.

   Active calls for nominations typically starts in September or October and go
   through the end of year.

3) Collect Contribution Statistics

   - Git commits

   - Mailing List Activity

   - Blog Posts and/or Talks

4) Announce the Champions.

   Champions are typically announced around Christmas/New Year.

5) Create and publish next years nomination form.

   Nominations can come throughout the year ( but usually only come when
   solicited ), so lets have a place to collect them.
